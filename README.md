# Coffee <img src='asset/image/logo.svg' width='32' height='32'>
A JavaScript game engine made for ease of use and simplicity, while still being quite open for modification and changes.

## Installation
To setup a Coffee project, paste this line of code in the terminal, making sure you are in the directory you want the project to be in. This will create a new folder named `<PROJECT NAME>`. Replace this text with the name of your project, making sure not to include the arrows.
```console
git clone https://github.com/d3vpz/coffee.git <PROJECT NAME>
```
## Updating
To update the Coffee library to the latest release, paste this text in your terminal, making sure your directory is set to the root directory of your project.
```console
sh update.sh
```
This will fetch the library and script files from the github repository and replace the old ones with the new ones. Don't worry, your project will stay the same.

### IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SCRIPT OR SCRIPT DOESN'T UPDATE
If you are on a version of Coffee that does not have the update script or the update script cannot update itself, write this command in the root of your project directory.
```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3vpz/coffee/main/update.sh -O update.sh
```
If you want to learn more, you can find documentation on the library [here.](https://github.com/d3vpz/coffee/wiki)
